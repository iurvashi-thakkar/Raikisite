Those who read the cards may have led the clients down the wrong path for too long.Tarot card decks were invented in the 1430s in Italy but the standard deck of modern Tarot was reinvented on the basis of the Venetian tarot.

                        Ayush, who is also a Reiki Healer, says there is no dearth of people asking questions about death, marriage, children, etc, during these sessions. He says that different people hold different notions about Tarot Card readings. This variety of notions is party encouraged by card readers who may or may not predict the future for their clients. But, in reality, Ayush cautions that those readers themselves aren’t aware of what is going to happen in their life two hours later. Therefore, he suggests, don’t believe that one can predict future events through such readings.

                During a Tarot Card reading session, the reader uses the deck of cards to gain insight into the individual's current state of mind, emotions, and life circumstances. The cards help the reader tap into the individual's energy and provide guidance on how to overcome challenges, improve relationships, and make better life choices. It is essential to understand that the cards are not a magic tool that can predict future events, but they serve as a tool to connect the individual with their inner wisdom and intuition.

                He concludes by saying, “Tarot card reading may not tell you all about your future but it definitely tells you how to make your present better. In the end, I believe that that is all that anybody would want, Tarot Card readings are not a means to predict the future, but rather a tool to provide guidance and insight into the present. It is up to the individual to use the guidance provided to make better life choices and shape their future positively. It is a complementary practice that can help individuals gain insight into their lives.
