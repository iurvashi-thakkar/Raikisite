                    We interact with a lot of people in our day to day life and often times we come across individuals with imbalanced energies, and it’s very usual for our energies to clash at that point which enervates our aura, and weaker aura leads to undesired circumstances and situations, also fondly known as our good of problems. And these problems can be fixed by transforming the negative energies into positive energy and stabilizing the aura.
