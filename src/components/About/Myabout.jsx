                        The youngest Reiki healer in the world, the youngest numerologist in the world, the youngest tarot card reader in India, and the author of the best-selling book "Reiki- Bhrahmand ki Rahasyamayi Oorja" are all named Ayush.
                        In addition to performing over 25000+ Tarot card readings, he has used Reiki to heal over 700 individuals.
                        Over 15 schools in India have successfully adopted a paradigm of meditative and spiritual disciplines. Many Bollywood and television celebrities acknowledge Ayush Gupta and since Ayush infuse good energy into their auras, these celebrities have noticed a significant improvement in both their lives and their auras. He decided that keeping this to himself would not be equitable and started offering Reiki healing to others. He played a significant role in dispelling misconceptions and breaking down barriers by being at the forefront of teaching people about Reiki and its benefits.
